--- Payroll Management System Help File ---

1. Commands Available
	There are a total of 4 commands that can be used to operate
	the program. 

	'(1) New Payroll' - This command is used to generate a new 
	payroll for employees. The program already knows how many 
	hours each employee works so, the only input that is 
	needed is the overtime hours.

	'(2) View Payroll' - This command is to be executed after the
	new payroll command and this will display the output of the
	various calculations such as gross pay, tax as well as net
	pay.
	
	'(3) New Employee' - This command will add a new employee to
	the payroll management system.
	
	'(4) Remove Employee' - This command will remove an employee
	from the payroll management system.

2. Additional Notes
	Employee Data Storage - At this current time, employee data 
	that is added during runtime using the '(3) New Employee'
	command is stored within memory. This results in the information
	being lost once the program stops. This could change in the 
	future whereby the employees information is saved into a file
	and then their information is loaded back up at startup.
